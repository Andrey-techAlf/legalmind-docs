  <h1>Terms of Service – Legal Mind</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 1, 2025</p>
  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Legal Mind mobile application
    (the “App”) provided by <strong>Andrei Alferchyk</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”).
    By installing or using the App you agree to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>

  <p>
    Legal Mind is an AI-powered assistant that explains legal documents in plain language,
    highlights potential risks, and provides general legal information.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your device and App installation.</li>
    <li>You agree not to misuse the App (for example, by attempting to break security or send automated spam requests).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. No Legal Advice</h2>

  <p>
    The App is for informational and educational purposes only.
    <strong>It is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice.</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI answers may be incomplete, outdated or inaccurate.</li>
    <li>Nothing in the App creates an attorney–client relationship.</li>
    <li>You should always consult a qualified lawyer before making important legal decisions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Accounts, Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Free tier.</strong> We may offer a free plan with limited usage (for example, a limited number of pages or questions per day).</li>
    <li><strong>Paid subscription.</strong> Additional usage may be available via in-app purchases or subscriptions managed by Apple App Store.</li>
    <li><strong>Billing.</strong> All payments, renewals and refunds are handled by Apple. Their terms and policies apply.</li>
    <li><strong>Changes.</strong> We may change prices, limits and plans in the future. Changes will apply to new billing periods.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Fair Use and Technical Limits</h2>

  <p>To protect the service for all users, we may apply technical limits, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Daily or monthly limits on the number of requests, pages, or tokens.</li>
    <li>Rate limits per device to prevent automated abuse.</li>
    <li>Blocking or throttling traffic that appears harmful or violates these Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. User Content</h2>

  <p>“User Content” means documents, text, and other material you upload or type into the App.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You retain ownership of your User Content.</li>
    <li>You grant us a limited license to process your User Content solely to provide the App’s features.</li>
    <li>You confirm that you have the rights and permissions necessary to use the content in this way.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>

  <p>
    The App, including its design, code, and branding, is owned by <strong>Andrei Alferchyk</strong>
    or our licensors. You receive a personal, non-transferable license to use the App for your own purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

  <p>
    The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis.
    We do not guarantee that the information generated by AI is correct, complete or suitable for any particular purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any decision you make based on information provided by the App;</li>
    <li>Loss of data, profits, business, or other indirect or consequential damages;</li>
    <li>Any issues caused by third-party services such as AI providers or app stores.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Our total liability for any claim related to the App will not exceed the amount you paid for the service
    in the last 3 months (or the minimum amount permitted by applicable law).
  </p>

  <h2>9. Termination</h2>

  <p>
    You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device.
    We may suspend or terminate your access if you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms
    or misuse the service.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to the Terms</h2>

  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the
    “Effective date” above. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the new Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>

  <p>
    These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>the Republic of Belarus</strong>, without regard to
    conflict-of-laws rules. Local consumer protection rules may give you additional rights.
