  <h1>Privacy Policy – Legal Mind</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 1, 2025</p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>[YOUR NAME / COMPANY]</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”)
    collects, uses, and protects information when you use the Legal Mind mobile application
    (the “App”).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>We designed Legal Mind to minimize personal data. In the App we may process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device identifier</strong> (random ID generated by the App) – used for rate limits, free / premium access, and abuse prevention.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage metadata</strong> – such as request timestamps, model type, number of tokens, approximate prompt length, language, and error codes.</li>
    <li><strong>Content you provide</strong> – text you type in the legal chat and documents you review (scans, PDFs, images, pasted text).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Documents and prompts are processed only to provide AI analysis.
     We do not use your documents to train our own models.</p>

  <h2>2. How Your Information Is Used</h2>

  <p>We use the data described above for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide document analysis, summaries, risk highlights, and legal chat responses.</li>
    <li>To operate core features such as history, export, and usage limits.</li>
    <li>To prevent abuse (for example, excessive automated requests or attacks).</li>
    <li>To improve stability and performance of the App (error logs and diagnostics).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Processing on Device vs Cloud</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>On-device processing.</strong> Where possible, pre-processing (such as anonymization or OCR) happens locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud processing.</strong> For AI analysis we send your prompts and documents to our AI provider.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We may automatically remove or mask obvious personal identifiers (names, emails, phone numbers)
     before sending text to the cloud, where technically possible.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services (AI Provider)</h2>

  <p>
    Legal Mind uses external AI models (for example, Google Gemini or similar providers)
    to generate analysis and answers. When you send a request, the following may be sent to the AI provider:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The text of your prompt or extracted text from your document.</li>
    <li>Minimal technical metadata (language, model type, safety filters).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These providers process your data to return AI responses. They do not receive your name, email,
    or direct contact details from us, unless you include them yourself in the text of the document.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Storage and Retention</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>History inside the App.</strong> Your past analyses and chats may be saved locally on your device so you can reopen them.</li>
    <li><strong>Temporary files.</strong> Scans and audio may be stored in temporary directories and are removed after processing or within a short period.</li>
    <li><strong>Server logs.</strong> We may keep minimal logs (device ID, time, endpoint, token usage, error codes) for security and accounting. These logs do not contain full document text.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We keep data only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, unless a longer
    period is required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Legal Basis (EEA / UK users)</h2>

  <p>If you are in the EEA or UK, we process your personal data on the following legal bases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – to provide the App and its features.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to prevent abuse, secure our services, and understand basic usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> – when you explicitly agree to certain optional processing (for example, specific analytics or marketing, if implemented).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>

  <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access personal data we process about you.</li>
    <li>Request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your data, where applicable.</li>
    <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <strong>[CONTACT EMAIL]</strong>.</p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    Legal Mind is not directed to children under 16. If you are under the minimum age in your jurisdiction,
    you may use the App only with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>

  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update
    the “Effective date” at the top of the page. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Policy.
  </p>
